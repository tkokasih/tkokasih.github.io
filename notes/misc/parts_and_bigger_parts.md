Draft points:
* Atoms is not alive
* Cells is alive
* Cells composed of atoms
* Somewhere, the 'alive' properties emerged.

* How about nucleus? DNA? Ribosome? Mitochondria? Are those alive?

* Cell is alive, but what does it mean to be alive?
* If the cell is suspended in environment where it cannot survive, it will be dead.
  * So, does alive comes with its compatibility with the environment? Or it is inherent to the thing itself?


If we take this point to bigger scope: individual, teams, organization, society and civilization.

There are properties that are only observed at higher layer.
Can lower layer observe these properties? Or necessarily not possible?

Does a country 'see' other country like a human 'see' other human?
Like human relies on eyes and brain to process, country also have their "organelle"? <-- intro to political science please :(
