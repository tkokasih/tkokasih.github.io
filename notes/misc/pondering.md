## Human activities

In any place, how can we classify human activities?
Take for example a mining town (can be a spaceship mining a rather large asteroids), we will find the following "industries"
* Industries to maintain the populace:
  * Food and drinks
  * Clothing
  * Medical services
  * Housing
  * Policing of social order
  * Education (if the town spawn more than one generation)
  * Transport of human, goods and services
  * Communication
  * Financial services (?)

* Industries for the specific town:
  * Mining
  * Maintenance of mining equipment
