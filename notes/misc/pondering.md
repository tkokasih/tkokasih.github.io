## Human activities

In any place, how can we classify human activities?
Take for example a mining town (can be a spaceship mining a rather large asteroids), we will find the following "industries"
* Industries to maintain the populace:
  * Food and drinks
  * Clothing
  * Medical services
  * Housing
  * Policing of social order
  * Education (if the town spawn more than one generation)
  * Transport of human, goods and services
  * Communication
  * Financial services (?)

* Industries for the specific town:
  * Mining
  * Maintenance of mining equipment

## Layer of Abstraction and Set Theory?

Programmings is about layers of abstractions.
At the bottom (not the most bottom), is logic gates.
Then it becomes instruction set at CPU levels.
Then OS/kernels.

There are other sets of abstractions, mainly coming from data-structure:
* List
* Set
* Map
* Graph

And there are domain-specific abstraction/concepts:
* Cryptography
* Encoding
* Account
* SQL
* Transactions
* Certificates, etc.

Questions: Is there a connection between set theory and these abstractions? Does these abstration represent one group in set theory?
