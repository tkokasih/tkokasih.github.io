## Background

People have non-linear thoughts,
and yet our medium of information is optimized for linear thoughts.
I'm particularly focused on computer note-taking,
which usually happens in text.

I'm always disturbed by this way of organizing information.
And my attempts to solve this, thus far, has been fruitless.


OneNote is a good example that you can somewhat create a non-linear notes.
You can start a new box to contain a stray away thoughts.
Or just another thoughts.
I used it as it is easily shareable with my wife.

However, it bothers me that OneNote:
* No vim keybinding

  On particularly dense and long, technical notes, it breaks my train of thoughts having to move around with mouse

* No syntax highlight

  Enough said
