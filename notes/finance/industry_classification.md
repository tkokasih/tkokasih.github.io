## Background

With a lot of companies out there, is there a standard taxonomy of the company?

## GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard)

This standard classified companies into 4 levels:
* 11 sectors
* 24 industry groups
* 69 industries
* 158 sub-industries

## Certainly, there are more than 1 standard

Yeah, countries also need their own taxonomy for their own purposes (tax, laws, etc.)
