## Background

Having impressed that there is 'air power tools', I was wondering how else can we store energy.

It turns out, there are a whole range of options to store energy other than battery or fuel.
Some of which:
* lifting tons of concrete
e.g. [Energy Vault](https://www.energyvault.com/),
* melting salt (how does it store the energy?),
* spinning flywheel,
* pumping water into dam
* and many more ways

## What are possible storage of energy?

| Storage   | Example  |
|:----------|:---------|
| Chemical  | battery, fossil fuel, etc. |
| Gravity   | lake/dam, concrete blocks  |
| Compressed air |    |
| Molten Salt   |    |
| Flywheel   | http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2020/ph240/barnett2/    |


A more extensive list is [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_storage).

## Stashed Questions

### How much typical energy cost?

To be looked around the internet. Some that are of interests:
* Electricity from the grid
* Electricity from battery
* Gas
* Fuel/petrol

### How much typical appliance running cost?

* Monitor, laptop, fridge, raspberrypi, smartphone, ...


### Is it feasible to replace lightbulb with gravity light

We pull up a weight and a mechanism will convert it to light throughout the night.

### If human regulate its body temperature and radiates heat, can we capture this heat?

If so, is it enough to power electronics that goes with people? like smartphone? or hearing aid.

### How about human's movement?

Good for charging while hiking, for example.

### Is there energy conversion that is more efficient?

Currently, energy distribution mainly means electrical grid, at least from my/consumer perspective. Is this conversion always efficient?

### Can we store energy in the form of photon?

You know, that particle that always escape or captured.
Is it possible for pure photon.
Sounds non-sensical.
