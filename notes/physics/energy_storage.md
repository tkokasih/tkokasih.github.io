## Background

Having impressed that there is 'air power tools', I was wondering how else can we store energy.

It turns out, there are a whole range of options to store energy other than battery or fuel.
Some of which includes lifting tons of concrete that will convert excess energy into potential energy,
e.g. [Energy Vault](https://www.energyvault.com/), 
molten salt,
flywheel,
and of course good old water in a dam.


## What are possible storage of energy?

| Storage   | Example  |
|:----------|:---------|
| Chemical  | battery, fossil fuel, etc. |
| Gravity   | lake/dam, concrete blocks  |
| Compressed air |    |
| Molten Salt   |    |
| Flywheel   | http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2020/ph240/barnett2/    |
