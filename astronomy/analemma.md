## Background

Walking home after work, I noticed the sun is not always in the same position at around the same time.

It shifted higher/lower and sideways.
What is the position of the sun given a longitude/latitude/altitude/time-of-day?

## Analemma

Analemma is sun's position in the sky throughout the year from the same lat/long/alt/time-of-day.

Here's how to get analemma in your location:
* For one year, take picture of the the sun's position at the same time (e.g. 07:00 in the morning) from the same spot.
* Congratulations, you get yourself the analemma of your longitude/latitude/altitude.


## Is there analytical way?

There should be. I haven't found any. Most probably because I haven't look hard enough in the internet.

Update: 
* This is as far as I go [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.03.047](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.03.047), and this paper is published 2021 ?!!
  This paper reference others which can be dug if we are really that interested.
