## Background

I'm fascinated by how the computer works.
From scratch.
If you turn on the power, what is it that the computer doing?

Some terms are flying around when looking to the internet on this process:
* BIOS
* UEFI
* kernel
* init
* shell
* initfs
* systemd
* ...

So, what is the process from pressing the power on button to the usable computer?
